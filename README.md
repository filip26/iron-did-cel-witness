# `did:cel` Witness Service

A **did:cel witness service** performing **oblivious witnessing**, issuing signed and timestamped attestations over cryptographic event log hashes using **Cloud KMS** in a serverless function environment. Importantly, the service **never sees the event content**, preserving privacy while providing verifiable proofs.

## Overview

Witnesses provide **cryptographic proofs** that an event existed at a specific time without accessing the event itself. This ensures **privacy, auditability, and integrity** in `did:cel` event logs.

Key features:

- **Oblivious witnessing** – operates only on hashes; the witness cannot see the event content.  
- **Signed & timestamped attestations** – cryptographically verifiable proofs.  
- **Cloud KMS integration** – secure key management for signing.  
- **Serverless function** – scalable, low-overhead execution.
